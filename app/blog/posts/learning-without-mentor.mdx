All these years, I've been on a journey of self-directed learning, navigating the vast sea of knowlewdge by myself.
Without a mentor to guide me, the path has been fraught with challenges.

Though i don't really find it too difficult to learn new things on my own. But, it is undeniably that having 
a mentor would have made the process significantly easier. Because in the end we all need guidance and support to 
reach our full potential.

One of the biggest challenges of learning without a mentor is the lack of direction.
Without someone to point me in the right direction, I have no clue if am i even on the right track.
This often leads to wasted time and effort as I try to figure things out on my own.

I remember learning how to code for the first time. I struggled implementing authentication systems, not knowing best practices 
or common pitfalls. It took me months of trial and error to finally get it right. But actually the prespective changed 
when I mentor someone else through the same process, It only take me a few days to help them implement it correctly. 
This experience made me realize how much thing could have been easier if I had a mentor back then.
This also made me understand the value of mentorship and the impact it can have on one's learning journey.

In conclusion, learning without a mentor is undeniably more challenging.
It is really recommended to seek out mentors or join communities where guidance and support are available.
By having a mentor, we can accelerate our learning, avoid common pitfalls, and ultimately reach our goals more efficiently.
So, if you have the opportunity to learn from a mentor, seize it. It will make all the difference in your learning journey.

And for all those who are learning without a mentor, stay persistent and keep pushing forward.
Remember, while the journey may be harder, it is not impossible. With determination and the right resources, 
you can achieve your learning goals.

And for mentors out there, your guidance can change lives. Never underestimate 
the power of your support in someone else's learning journey. Please just don't see your mentees as a source of income,
but rather as individuals seeking growth and knowledge. Embrace the role of a mentor and make a positive impact in someone's life.

Happy learning and mentoring!
