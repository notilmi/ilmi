I have a confession to make: I used to believe that motivation was a fuel I needed 
to find before I could start any meaningful work. I thought that if I just waited long enough, 
the perfect wave of inspiration would come crashing down on me, propelling me into action. 
Spoiler alert: it never did.

Motivation is often seen as this elusive force that we must chase after, but in reality, **IT IS NOT**
something that you wait for, instead **it is something you achieved through action**.
The more you wait for motivation, the more likely you are to fall into the trap of procrastination.

What you needed it's not motivation to start, but rather the **discipline** to take the first step,
through consistent actions, even when you don't feel like it. Motivation often follows action, 
not the other way around. When you start working towards your goals, even in small ways, 
you create momentum that can lead to increased motivation.

So, the next time you find yourself waiting for motivation to strike, remember this:
**Start taking action, no matter how small, and let motivation catch up with you.**
The journey to achieving your goals begins with that first step, 
not with waiting for the perfect moment of inspiration.
