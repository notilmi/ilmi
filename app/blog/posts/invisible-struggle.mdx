People sees the success, the smiles, the achievements, 
but what they don't see is the invisible struggle behind it all. 
Every individual fights battles that are unseen by the outside world.
These struggles can be mental, emotional, or physical, and they shape who we are.
It's important to acknowledge that everyone has their own invisible struggles.

Just like an iceberg, only a small portion of our struggles are visible to others.
The majority of our challenges lie beneath the surface, hidden from view.

These invisible struggles can lead to growth and resilience.
When we face and overcome our challenges, we become stronger, more empathetic towards the others...

In conclusion, invisible struggles are a universal experience.
By recognizing and respecting the battles that others may be facing, we can foster a more compassionate and understanding world.
Remember, everyone is fighting a battle you can't see. Be kind, always.
