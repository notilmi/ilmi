TLDR; Authentication works differently in enterprise environments compared to startup domains. It's more than just authentication itself.

I remember back when i started learning about software engineering, I always been paranoid about authentication.
To me, authentication is just the most important part of any application that requires user login. So I spent over 9 months
to learn everything about authentication, from OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SSO, JWT, and many more. Even I personally could built
a full fledged authentication system by myself from scratch.

The project I've built / worked with mostly leaned towards startup domains. But, after working in a more enterprise environment, 
I realized that authentication is more than just authentication itself. Authentication is just one piece of the puzzle. 
In enterprise applications, authentication is often tightly coupled with authorization, user management, auditing, and compliance requirements.

For example, in an enterprise setting, authentication mechanisms need to support complex user roles and permissions,
integration with existing identity management systems (like LDAP or Active Directory), and adherence to strict security policies.
This means that authentication solutions must be flexible and customizable to meet the specific needs of the organization.

Moreover, enterprises often require robust auditing and logging capabilities to track authentication events for security and compliance purposes.
This adds another layer of complexity to the authentication process, as it involves not only verifying user identities but also ensuring that all actions are properly recorded and monitored.

This experience has taught me that authentication is not just about verifying who a user is, but also about how that identity fits into a larger system of security and access control.
In conclusion, while my initial understanding of authentication was limited to the technical aspects of user verification,
my experience in enterprise environments has broadened my perspective. Authentication is a multifaceted process that encompasses various components beyond just the act of logging in.
It's a critical part of a comprehensive security strategy that requires careful consideration and integration with other systems.

So, for those of you who are diving into the world of authentication, remember that it's more than just the technical implementation.
It's about understanding the broader context in which authentication operates and how it interacts with other aspects of security and user management.
Embrace the complexity, and you'll be better equipped to design and implement effective authentication solutions that meet the needs of modern applications.
