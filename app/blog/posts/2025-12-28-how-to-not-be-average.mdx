> "If working hard was enough, a donkey would be the one who run the farm"

Funny quote right? but it's true.

Back in the day i used to think that working hard is the key to success.
So i worked, and worked, and worked. Late nights, early mornings, weekends, holidays, you name it.
But after timeless grind, i realized something...

I was stuck... In the same place, same knowledges, same life.

I was just... **Average**.

Being average is easy, comfortable even.
You just follow the crowd, do what everyone else is doing, and never step out of your comfort zone.

But here's a thing about being average: it won't get you anywhere.
To not be average, you have to be willing to do things differently. But not just differently, 
you have to be willing to do things that others are not willing to do, to do something that
you might even not feel comofrtable doing it.

Why? Because that's where the magic happens.
Growth came from doing thing outside of your comfort zone, taking risks, and embracing challenges,
not just following the crowd.

One thing that helped me to not be average is to always be learning.
Learning something that is out of my comfort zone, learning from something that challenge my
current knowledge, from something that give me huge risks, from something that scare me.
By constantly learning and growing, i was able to break free from the average mindset and achieve
things that i never thought possible.

So, if you want to not be average, start by embracing discomfort.
Take risks, try new things, and be willing to fail.

Fail is not the end, it's just a part of the journey, a journey to success.

Someone who succeed once but fails millions of times is still more successful 
than someone who never tries.
